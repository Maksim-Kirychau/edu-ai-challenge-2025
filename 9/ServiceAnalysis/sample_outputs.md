# Prompt - 1 -> telegram

# Service Analysis Report

## Brief History
Telegram was founded in 2013 by Pavel and Nikolai Durov, the creators of VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network. It quickly gained popularity as a secure messaging app with a focus on privacy and speed. Notable milestones include reaching 100 million monthly active users in 2016, introducing channels and bots, launching video calling in 2020, and hitting over 700 million active users by 2023.

## Target Audience
Telegram primarily targets tech-savvy users who prioritize privacy and security. This includes individuals seeking encrypted messaging, activists, journalists, communities building public or private groups, as well as businesses using bots and automation for customer engagement. It also appeals to users dissatisfied with other messaging platforms due to censorship or lack of privacy.

## Core Features
1. End-to-end encrypted Secret Chats; 2. Cloud-based messaging with synchronization across devices; 3. Large group support and Channels for broadcasting to unlimited audiences; 4. Bots and API integrations enabling automation and enhanced functionality.

## Unique Selling Points
Telegram’s key differentiators include its strong commitment2 to privacy without sacrificing speed, cloud-based messages accessible from any device, support for very large group chats (up to 200,000 members), unlimited file sharing up to 2GB per file, and extensive automation via bots. Its open API and developer-friendly ecosystem are also unique compared to closed competitors.

## Business Model
Telegram initially operated without ads or subscription fees, funded by the founders. The service began exploring monetization with the introduction of Telegram Premium, a subscription plan offering enhanced features. It also plans to incorporate non-intrusive ads in large public channels, focusing on privacy-preserving advertising to sustain operational costs while maintaining a free messaging experience.

## Tech Stack Insights
Telegram’s architecture centers on a distributed cloud infrastructure for fast message delivery and synchronization. The client apps are built natively for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux. The MTProto protocol is Telegram’s proprietary messaging protocol optimizing encryption and speed. The use of multiple data centers worldwide hints at scalable, distributed server technologies, likely involving C++ and other performant languages for backend systems.

## Perceived Strengths
Users praise Telegram for its speed, reliability, and strong privacy features. The breadth of features like large groups, bots, channels, and file sharing make it versatile. Its multi-platform availability and seamless sync enhance user experience. The open API encourages a rich ecosystem of third-party tools. Many also highlight Telegram’s resistance to censorship and its transparent approach to encryption protocols.

## Perceived Weaknesses
Critics point out that Telegram’s default chats are not end-to-end encrypted, which may confuse users expecting all messages to have maximum privacy. The proprietary MTProto protocol has faced scrutiny for not being as thoroughly vetted as open-source protocols like Signal’s. Some also note that Telegram’s focus on privacy sometimes results in lax moderation, leading to challenges with spam or harmful content in large groups and channels. Additionally, monetization efforts like ads have sparked concern among users.
