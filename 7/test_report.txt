## Areas for Improvement

1. **Coverage Gaps**
   - Edge cases in CPU strategy
   - Complex game state transitions
   - Error handling scenarios

2. **Test Enhancements**
   - Add integration tests
   - Implement end-to-end testing
   - Add performance benchmarks

3. **Code Quality**
   - Add TypeScript for better type safety
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add input validation

4. **Future Features**
   - Multiplayer support
   - Save/load game state
   - Difficulty levels
   - UI implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining edge case tests
2. Add integration test suite
3. Improve error handling coverage
4. Add performance testing
5. Implement UI layer tests

## Conclusion
The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of core game functionality with an overall coverage of 91%. The remaining gaps are primarily in edge cases and complex state transitions. Future improvements should focus on integration testing and UI implementation.
