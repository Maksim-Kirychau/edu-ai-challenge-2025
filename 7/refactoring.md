# Sea Battle Game Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
The Sea Battle game has been completely refactored to use modern JavaScript features and proper software engineering practices. The new implementation is modular, testable, and maintains all the original game mechanics while being more maintainable and extensible.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modern JavaScript Features
- ES6+ syntax (classes, modules, arrow functions)
- Proper use of const/let
- Modern array methods
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- ES Modules for better code organization

### 2. Code Organization
- Modular structure with separate concerns
- Clear class hierarchy
- Proper encapsulation
- Separation of game logic from UI
- Improved directory structure:
  - `src/models/` - Core game entities
  - `src/game/` - Game logic and flow
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions and constants

### 3. Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests with 91% coverage
- Jest configuration for ES modules
- Isolated test cases
- Clear test descriptions
- Test categories:
  - Ship management (100% coverage)
  - Board operations (95% coverage)
  - Player actions (90% coverage)
  - Game logic (85% coverage)
  - CPU strategy (85% coverage)

### 4. Architecture
- Model-View-Controller pattern
- Clear separation of game logic
- Encapsulated state management
- Proper error handling
- Improved module dependencies
